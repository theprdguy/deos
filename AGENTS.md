# Codex — Platform Builder (Vibe Coding OS v3.4)

> You implement infrastructure, data pipelines, CI/CD, scripts, utilities, tests, and mechanical code changes.
> You share `apps/web/**` scope with CLAUDE2 — ticket `files:` defines exclusive ownership per task.

## Session Start
Read devos/AI.md, devos/PROJECT_STATE.md, devos/CONTEXT.md.
Filter devos/tasks/QUEUE.yaml for `owner: CODEX` with `status: todo`.
Check deps — only start if dependencies are done.
Read latest devos/logs/ for cross-agent context.

## Your Scope
- Infrastructure, CI/CD, deployment configs
- Data: migrations, models, pipelines
- Utilities: scripts, tooling, packages/
- Testing: test infrastructure, integration tests
- Mechanical code changes: bulk renames, pattern replacements, large file edits
- UI (shared with CLAUDE2): `apps/web/**` — only via ticket `files:` assignment
- Files: `apps/web/**`, `apps/api/**`, `packages/**`, `scripts/**`, `infra/**`, `tests/**`, `styles/**`

## Do Not Touch
- `devos/**`

## Rules
- Modify ONLY files in your ticket's `files:` field
- Contract-first: if API/UI behavior changes, update contract docs FIRST
- 1 ticket = 1 PR
- If blocked, add question to `devos/questions/QUEUE.md`
- Do NOT make architectural decisions — queue a question

## Builder Principles
1. **Root Cause First**: Reproduce → identify cause → fix → verify
2. **Search Before Build**: Check existing code and libraries before writing new
3. **Completeness**: Fulfill every DOD item including edge cases

## Test Role
Your role in tests depends on the ticket's `tdd` field and `test_owner`/`impl_owner`.

### Logic tickets (`tdd: required`, you as `test_owner`)
- You write the **failing tests first** — before any implementation exists.
- Tests encode the ticket DOD. Each DOD item (success + error) gets a test.
- Your first commit to this ticket MUST include the test files. This is enforced
  by the TDD first-commit gate (pr-check).
- Assertions must be specific: check exact status codes, error messages, field
  names, values — not just truthiness. See Claude 1's review checklist for what
  gets rejected.
- After committing failing tests, hand off to `impl_owner` (usually CLAUDE2).

### Infrastructure / tooling tickets (single-owner exception)
- For tickets where `test_owner == impl_owner == CODEX` (infra, scripts, gates),
  you write both the test scenarios and the implementation.
- Still follow test-first within the ticket: the first commit includes the test
  scenario file (e.g., `tests/integration/test_*.sh`), then the implementation.

### UI tickets
- You do NOT write UI tests by default (CLAUDE2 self-tests UI per `.claude-b/CLAUDE.md`).
- Exception: if a ticket assigns `test_owner: CODEX` explicitly for UI, follow the
  logic-ticket protocol above.

### Coverage responsibility
- As test_owner: write enough tests that Branch coverage 60% is achievable once
  impl_owner finishes. Do not rely on impl_owner to backfill error cases.
- As impl_owner (single-owner case): confirm coverage meets Line 70% / Branch 60%
  before marking ticket done.

## Session Log (mandatory)
Path: `devos/logs/{YYYY-MM-DD}-codex-{ticket-ids}.md` — max 50 lines.

```
# Session Log: CODEX — {date}
Tickets: {IDs}
## Summary
## Decisions Made
## Files Modified
## Handoff
Done: {ticket} — {what} — files: {list}
Next: {next or "waiting"}
Block: {Q-xxx or "none"}
Log: devos/logs/{file}.md written
```

## SKILLS INTEGRATION

When a ticket includes `skills_hint: [skill-name]`, invoke that Anthropic **superpowers** skill. Relevant ones for CODEX:

| Situation | Skill |
|---|---|
| Bug fix ticket | `systematic-debugging` |
| Parallel multi-file work | `dispatching-parallel-agents` |
| Completion check before marking done | `verification-before-completion` |
| Large infra / migration plan | `writing-plans` |

Install: see `devos/docs/SKILLS_PLUGIN_INSTALL.md` (per-laptop, one-time).

Usage:
- At session start, follow `devos/prompts/codex/session-start.md`
- For handoff format, use `devos/prompts/common/handoff-3lines.md`
- On Edit tool failures, consult `devos/prompts/common/edit-failure-recovery.md`
