# AI Operating Rules (Vibe Coding OS v3.4)

## Purpose
Run continuous parallel work across 3 AI agents from a single laptop.
Claude 1 plans and researches. Claude 2 and Codex implement.

## Builder ETHOS
> When judgment criteria conflict, `devos/ETHOS.md` is the tiebreaker. It defines the
> Iron Laws + Boil-the-Lake principle + Honest Cost Table + non-developer protection.

## SSOT Precedence

### Truth-conflict order (when sources disagree)
1) PROJECT_STATE.md
2) docs/API_CONTRACT.md + docs/UI_CONTRACT.md
3) docs/ADR/*
4) tasks/QUEUE.yaml
5) Code
6) Session logs (devos/logs/)
7) Chat logs (least reliable)

### Session-start read map (which agent reads what)
| File | CLAUDE1 | CLAUDE2 | CODEX |
|---|---|---|---|
| `devos/AI.md` | ✅ (via @import) | ✅ (via @import) | ✅ |
| `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | ✅ | — | — |
| `.claude-b/CLAUDE.md` | — | ✅ | — |
| `AGENTS.md` | — | — | ✅ |
| `devos/docs/BUILDER_GUIDE.md` | — | ✅ | ✅ |
| `devos/PROJECT_STATE.md` | ✅ | on demand | on demand |
| `devos/CONTEXT.md` | ✅ | on demand | on demand |
| `devos/tasks/QUEUE.yaml` | ✅ | ticket scope only | ticket scope only |
| `devos/questions/QUEUE.md` | ✅ | — | — |
| `devos/logs/{latest}` | ✅ | — | — |

"on demand" = read when ticket context requires. `@import` = transitively loaded via CLAUDE.md frontmatter.

## Dispatch Model

Every dispatched ticket runs as a **fresh session**. No prior conversation history is injected.

What gets loaded at dispatch:
- The ticket body (goal / context / dod / constraints / files / verify)
- Files listed in the session-start read map for the target agent
- MEMORY.md (auto-memory, if populated)

Implications:
- Tickets MUST be self-contained. A builder reading only the ticket + SSOT must be able to execute.
- `context:` field is where CLAUDE1 parks research findings that would otherwise need chat history.
- **No recursive dispatch**: a running ticket must not invoke `make dispatch` or spawn another agent session. Escalate via `devos/questions/QUEUE.md` instead.

## Memory Save Triggers (auto-memory MEMORY.md)

CLAUDE1 should write to MEMORY.md proactively — don't wait to be asked — when:
- User corrects or overrides a default behavior (save the corrected rule + why)
- User states a preference, habit, or quality bar
- A project-specific convention is discovered (ticket format, hook behavior, naming)
- A library/API quirk is confirmed via research (model alias vs pin, etc.)
- A completed work item produces a reusable insight

Skip when:
- Easily re-discoverable from code / git log / SSOT
- One-off session state (current ticket, temporary variables)
- Duplicates existing memory — update instead of appending

## Operational Guidelines

- **Session length**: If a single Claude Code session exceeds ~4 hours or context feels thrashing, `/clear` and start fresh with a handoff log. Context rotation preserves late-session quality; repeated compression degrades it.
- **Edit uniqueness**: `Edit.old_string` must be unique within the file — include 2–3 lines of surrounding context, not just the changed line. On ambiguous matches, run Grep first to see all occurrences before deciding `replace_all` vs. widening the anchor.
- **Edit failure recovery**: On `File has been modified since read`, Re-Read the file then retry once. On `String not found`, Read/Grep to confirm actual content before rewriting `old_string`. 3 consecutive failures = stop and report. See `devos/prompts/common/edit-failure-recovery.md`.

## Roles

| Agent | Role | Can Modify | Cannot Modify |
|-------|------|-----------|---------------|
| **CLAUDE1** | Planner + Researcher + SSOT manager | devos/**, config files, AGENTS.md | apps/**, packages/**, tests/** |
| **CLAUDE2** | App builder (backend + GUI design/impl) | apps/api/src/**, apps/web/** | devos/ |
| **CODEX** | Platform builder (infra + data + tests + mechanical) | apps/web/**, apps/api/**, packages/**, infra/**, scripts/**, tests/**, styles/** | devos/ |

## Role Boundaries
- CLAUDE1 MUST NOT write implementation code
- CLAUDE1 creates tickets with WHAT + CONTEXT; builders decide HOW
- Builders MUST NOT modify files outside their ticket scope
- Builders MUST NOT make architectural decisions — queue questions instead

## Model Tiering
- **CLAUDE1**: user selects per session via `/model` + `/effort`. Not pinned in `.claude/settings.json`.
  Default guidance — heavy planning/review/mutation judgment: Opus 4.7 with `xhigh`. Light triage/status: Sonnet or Opus at default effort.
- **CLAUDE2**: pinned to `"sonnet"` alias in `.claude-b/settings.json` (auto-tracks latest Sonnet). `/fast` mode available.
- **CODEX**: `codex` CLI — Anthropic model rollouts do not apply.

Pinning principle: prefer family aliases (`sonnet`, `opus`) over minor-version IDs so releases propagate without manual config edits. Pin a specific version only with a reproducibility rationale.

## Ticket Standard
- `status`: Must be `todo` for new tickets — dispatcher only picks up `todo`
- `goal`: What to build (behavioral requirement)
- `context`: Why + technical research from Claude 1
- `constraints`: Technical constraints
- `dod`: Acceptance criteria — each item must be verifiable (input + expected output).
  **If a success-case DOD exists, a failure/error-case DOD is mandatory.**
- `files`: Files to modify (ownership scope)
- `verify`: How to check completion
- `deps`: Prerequisite tickets
- `gates`: Verification steps run after completion (tests, secrets scan, review)
- `tdd`: `required` | `skip` | `self-evident` (default: `skip` if missing)
  - `required`: first commit must include test files — enforced by pr-check gate
  - `skip`: docs, config, refactor, mechanical tickets — no test-first requirement
  - `self-evident`: bug-fix with obvious reproduction — waiver logged to session log
- `test_owner`: Agent that writes tests (for `tdd: required` cross-test tickets).
  Defaults to `owner` if missing. Use `n/a` for policy/doc tickets.
- `impl_owner`: Agent that writes implementation. Defaults to `owner` if missing.
  Dispatcher uses `impl_owner` as the target agent when set.
- `cross_model`: `true` | `false` (default `false`). When `true`, CLAUDE1 invokes CODEX
  for second-opinion review on the deliverable. Recommended for critical-path tickets
  (auth, payment, permissions, data integrity). See `devos/prompts/claude/cross-model-review.md`.
- `security_audit`: `true` | `false` (default `false`). **Auto-forced `true`** for tickets
  touching auth, payment, permissions, or external input. Triggers OWASP/STRIDE review
  per `devos/prompts/claude/security-audit.md`.

## Scope-Reduction Prohibition
Ticket goal/dod/context must not contain scope-reducing vocabulary
("v1 for now", "static for now", "TODO", "placeholder", "temporary", "later",
"simplified", "basic version", "minimal implementation", "quick fix", "wired later",
"skip for now", "future enhancement", "hardcoded for now"). Full list and exceptions:
`devos/prompts/common/scope-reduction-prohibition.md`. The Step 4 self-check in
`decompose-prd.md` is mandatory — `grep` must return zero hits before a ticket can
enter the queue.

## Non-negotiables
- 1 PR = 1 Ticket
- Ownership: only the ticket owner may modify files in ticket.files
- Contract-first: if API/UI behavior changes, update contract docs first
- Done = all gates pass
- Session log written before ending

## Builder Principles

### 1. Root Cause First
Before patching a bug: reproduce, identify root cause, fix, verify reproduction fails.
Record the cause in session log.

### 2. Search Before Build
Check the project for existing utilities and libraries before writing new code.
Duplicate implementations create maintenance debt.

### 3. Completeness
Fulfill every DOD item. Do not skip edge cases, error handling, or empty states.

## Question Queue
- If blocked, add to devos/questions/QUEUE.md (Options + Recommendation + Default)
- Non-blocking: proceed with Default
- Blocking: mark that ticket as blocked

## Testing Policy

### 1. Maturity Ceiling: **Phase 3.5**
Contract tests + UI smoke tests + scenario integration tests.
Full E2E (Phase 4+) is out of scope due to maintenance cost for solo + AI operation.

### 2. Coverage Gate
- **Line 70% / Branch 60%** enforced as PR gate.
- Branch coverage is the enforcement mechanism for error-case completeness
  (Line-only passes if every function's happy path is tested).
- **Grace period**: first 3 tickets of each app (subdirectory under `apps/`)
  run in report-only mode. Threshold enforcement starts from the 4th ticket.

### 3. DOD Error-case Rule
Each success-case DOD item must have corresponding failure/error-case DOD.
Example:
- `POST /auth/login with valid credentials returns 200 + JWT` (success)
- `POST /auth/login with wrong password returns 401 + error message` (error)
- `POST /auth/login with missing email returns 400 + validation error` (error)

### 4. TDD: Partial Application
- **Applies**: `apps/api/**`, `packages/shared/**` (business logic)
- **Excluded**: `apps/web/**` UI components (design iteration priority)
- **Enforcement**: `tdd: required` tickets must include test files in the
  first ticket-scoped commit, enforced by `pr-check` gate.
- **First-commit judgment**: `git log --reverse --grep='{ticket_id}'` → head commit
  must touch a file matching test patterns: `tests/**`, `**/*_test.*`,
  `**/*.test.*`, `**/*.spec.*`.

### 5. Test Authorship: Hybrid (Cross-test / Self-test)
- **Logic tickets (`tdd: required`)**: cross-test. `test_owner: CODEX`, `impl_owner: CLAUDE2`.
  CODEX commits failing tests first; CLAUDE2 commits implementation that passes them.
- **UI tickets (`tdd: skip`)**: self-test. Builder writes their own tests after implementation.
- **Infra/tooling tickets**: single-owner (CODEX for both test_owner and impl_owner).
- **Review**: Claude 1 reviews all test commits for assertion specificity and
  DOD↔test mapping. See `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for the full checklist.

### 6. Mutation Testing: On-demand
- No schedule. Claude 1 proposes; user approves; runs overnight via `at 02:00` on
  the active laptop.
- **Claude 1 proposes when**:
  1. 3~5 business-logic tickets completed in a row (auth, payment, permissions, …)
  2. 3+ suspected tautological tests found during review
  3. Right before a release/deploy tag
  4. User voices doubt about test quality
  5. 200+ lines of business logic changed since last mutation run
- Reports: `devos/logs/mutation/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`
- Claude 1 reviews the report next session and creates follow-up tickets for gaps.

### 7. Common Baseline Gates (All Tickets)
`make pr-check` runs these independent of stack:
1. Secret scan (gitleaks)
2. Contract sync check (contract doc ↔ code co-modification)
3. Ticket scope guard (files outside ticket's `files:` list)
4. Session log presence (`devos/logs/{date}-{agent}.md`)
5. TDD first-commit gate (only for `tdd: required` tickets)

### 8. Stack Deferral (Stage 0 Principle)
Testing infrastructure is layered:
- **Stack-agnostic**: baseline gates, ticket schema, TDD hook — set up once up-front.
- **Stack-dependent**: test runners (pytest, Vitest, Playwright), coverage tools —
  included as part of the **first ticket for each app**, not pre-installed.
  Claude 1 researches current stack via context7/MCP when that first ticket arrives.
