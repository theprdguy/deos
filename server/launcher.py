"""`os3 open <name>` — single entry primitive for project sessions.

Resolves a project (registry repo_path, else host/projects/<name>), then launches
`claude` there with the host settings injected (`--settings <host>/.claude/settings.json`)
so settings/hooks attach even though Claude Code does not walk ancestors for settings.
Host-owned sub-agent definitions are intentionally not copied or linked into projects;
Claude Code discovers the host `.claude/agents` directory by walking ancestors from
project cwd, while settings still require explicit injection.
The command string is built by a pure function (testable); the handler execs it.
